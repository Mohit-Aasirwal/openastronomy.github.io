OpenAstronomy is a collaboration between open source astronomy and astrophysics
projects to share resources, ideas, and to improve code.

## Principles of OpenAstronomy

The core principles of OpenAstronomy (OA) include:

1. Open Source: OA projects are committed to their software being Open Source[1]. This promotes accessibility, reliability, and scientific reproducibility.
[1] https://opensource.org/docs/osd
2. Open Development: OA projects support the principle of "open development"[1], a model where the software is both *by* and *for* the community.  More concretely, these projects try to work in publicly-visible spaces, encouraging discussion and participation from their public user community on both code and project-level decisions.
[1] Tollerud, E., “Sustaining Community-Driven Software for Astronomy in the 2020s”, vol. 51, no. 7, 2019.
3. Open Science: OA projects support open and accessible data and reproducible science both through good data management practices and effective open software.

## Get involved with OpenAstronomy

If you want to get involved with OpenAstronomy or maybe you have a project that
would like to join the collaboration, please feel free to get in touch. The
OpenAstronomy organisation has a mailing list (<a
href="mailto:openastronomy@googlegroups.com">openastronomy@googlegroups.com</a>)
which is good place to introduce yourself.

You can also get involved by joining our chat using either:
Matrix
([#openastronomy:matrix.org](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#openastronomy:matrix.org)),
IRC (<a href="{{ site.irc_freenode }}#{{site.irc_channel }}">#openastronomy
on freenode.net</a>), [gitter](https://gitter.im/OpenAstronomy/Lobby) or [slack](https://openastronomy.slack.com) which regularly has a number of people in it, if you want
to pop in for an astronomy related conversation.
